# Customer Insights

Welcome to the Customer Insights challenge for 'The General Store'! 
As a Customer Insights Analyst, I analyzed the provided tables to gain crucial information about our customers and provide valuable insights to our marketing team.

Database Schema

The challenge included the following tables:

country: This table stores information about countries, including country_id, country_name, and head_office.

customers: This table contains customer details such as customer_id, first_shop date, age, rewards, and can_email status.

orders: This table tracks customer orders with order_id, customer_id, date_shop, sales_channel, and country_id.

products: This table stores product information, including product_id, category, and price.

baskets: This table represents the items added to each order, linking order_id and product_id.

Questions

I answered the following questions using SQL queries:

1. What are the names of all the countries in the country table?
2. How many customers do we have in total?
3. What is the average age of customers who can receive marketing emails?
4. How many orders were made by customers aged 30 or older?
5. What is the total revenue generated by each product category?
6. What is the average price of products in the 'food' category?
7. How many orders were made in each sales channel?
8. What is the date of the latest order made by a customer who can receive marketing emails?
9. Which country has the highest number of orders?
10. What is the average age of customers who made orders in the 'vitamins' product category?

I ran SQL queries on the provided tables to find the answers to these questions and presented the results to our marketing team.
